      <p>This help page summarizes how to configure Users, Credentials, Groups, Schedules, Doors and Schedule Mappings so door access works as expected. See the README for full details.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create Users; optionally group them.</li>
        <li>Create Credentials (RFID) with correct card-id and nb-bits; optionally set Owner.</li>
        <li>Create Schedules with timeframes.</li>
        <li>Create Schedule Mappings that connect Schedules to Users/Groups/Credentials and target Doors. If no doors are set, the mapping applies to all doors.</li>
        <li>Verify by presenting the credential at the door and checking Audit/ Dashboard for GRANTED/DENIED.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Auth decision is made by Leosac using the mapping and current time. The result is logged as an AuthEvent.</p>
